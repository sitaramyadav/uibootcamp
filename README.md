#UI Bootcamp - 007s  

#Aim
Create a Tweet deck clone [like this](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com) while going through basic concepts of ReactJS and Redux.  

# Brunch + Redux + React + Babel/ES6

## Installation

Clone this repo

## Getting started

* Install (if you don't have them):
    * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): `brew install node` on OS X
    * [Brunch](http://brunch.io): `npm install -g brunch`
    * `cd` into this repo and Brunch plugins and app dependencies: `npm install`
* Run:
    * `brunch watch --server` — watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server with [pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).
    * `brunch build --production` — builds minified project for production
* Learn:
    * `public/` dir is fully auto-generated and served by HTTP server. Write your code in `app/` dir.
    * Place static files you want to be copied from `app/assets/` to `public/`.
